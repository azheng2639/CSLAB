/*
a vector is a container structure acting as a dynamically growing array
it is represented with the following field:
	a) size - array capacity representing the maximum number of elements that can be
	inseted before the array must grow
	b) length - the actual number of inserted elements
		length <= size
	c) items - array of elements

a vector has the following methods
	1) Insert(idx, item);
		A value of idx == length inserts item at the end

a) a tree is a rooted, connected, and cycle free graph
	1) one of the verticies is the root
	2) there are no disconnected verticies
	3) there is no path that leads one verticie to itself

b) binary tree - a tree where each node has at most two children

c) a complete tree - a tree in which all leaves have the same distance to the root

d) nearly complete tree - a tree in which the difference in distance between two leaves and the root can only be 1 or 0

e) heap - a nearly complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater or equal to the value of its children
	1) should not be confused with Binary Search Tree (BST)
	2) a heap supports the following operations
		i) Sink(int idx) given a node at pos idx, whose left and right subtrees are correct heaps, but where no index < node Left(idx), or Right(idx)  this operation fixes the entire subtree staring at idx by progressively sinking the node
		 	I) O(logn)
		ii) Float(int idx) given a heap where only the node at pos idx may violate its order requirements relevant to its parent, this operation fixes the entire heap by progressively floating the node towards the root
	3) Insert(int value)
		i) insert value at the end
		ii) float the value
	4) ExtractMax()
		i) swap the root with the last element
		ii) save the lowest value, which was originally the root to be returned later
		iii) sink the root, which is now the lowest element
